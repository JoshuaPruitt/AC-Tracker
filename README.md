## Description

This web app helps anyone playing Animal Crossing New Horizons to keep track of the creatures they have collected in game. The app enables users to search for creatures they have collected and yet to collect. It has various categories for bugs, fish, sea creatures, and currently available items. Users can enable or disable categories at will using the filters tab. When a user clicks on a creature, it shows a mini screen showing the details of that creature. When a user clicks on the same creature again they can save the creature to their collected creatures. A user can then save their collected creatures by clicking save at the bottom of the page. If a user wishes to remove their data they can click on the clear button at the bottom of the page and remove all their data.

## Instalation

Once the files have been installed onto your computer you can open an instance of your prefered command shell in the files. Use "npm run install" to install the dependancies. Then use "npm run build" to build the files. Finally you can use "npm run dev" to run the files. The terminal will give you the site link and port. Generally the link should look like this [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) unless you changed the port.

## Technical-Details

The web app was built in React typescript using vite. Tailwind Css was used to style the pages. Assets from nintendo were used to show each creature. This app is still pretty early in development. This is the first major build of the app.

I had to build a seperate tool for this application to format data correctly. Took a bit of time to create and helps make uniform data for the site to read. You can find the tool [Here!](https://github.com/JoshuaPruitt/AC-Tracker-Formatter)

In the future I was possibly looking to make a template site and tool in case me or others was looking to make tools using my site for other games. Right now as is it would probably take a fair bit of work to remove all of the animal crossing-ness out of the site and formater tool.

## What to possibly look forward to

Im looking to possibly add quite a few features in the future. Things like, a search bar to search for individual creatures, new page styling, added filters for ease of use, better mobile support, more settings for users, and support for other animal crossing games.
